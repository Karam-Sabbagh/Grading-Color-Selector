# Grading-Color-Selector
Grading color selector is a tool for editing images.
And this tool's benifit is that it can changes the color of pixels all over the image that are selected by their color too
but not just like selecting them by one color but its selected by a scale between two color values you put.

Like you can say select pixeles that has the scale of a color between 0, 0, 0 and 255, 255, 255 and change their color to 255, 0, 0,
and what this program will do is that it will change all of the pixeles thay has a color between black and white (grays, black, white).
